                        <p>IBIENERGY was founded to fill a clear gap in the market â€“ an advisory firm led by technical and commercial specialists from across AEMO, generators, networks and OEMs. The NEM's leading experts across the energy transition combined into a consultancy. Our lessons and expertise told us successful integration requires whole-of-system thinking, so we purpose built a firm of leadership tier specialists to do just that.</p>
                        <p>With over 400 years' combined experience across our leadership and specialist teams, we guide and learn from the next generation of hand-picked SMEs to form a purpose-built firm that knows the power system from end-to-end. Our focus encompasses translating the technical into the strategic approach and commercial model design.</p>
